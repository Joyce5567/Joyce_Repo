Space Oddity
David Bowie

Ground Control to Major Tom,
Ground Control to Major Tom,
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.

Ground Control to Majot Tom,
Commencing countdown, engines on.
Check ignition and may God's love be with you.

This is Ground Control to Major Tom,
You've really made the grade
And the papers want know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare.

"This is Major Tom to Ground Control,
I'm stepping through the door.
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way,
and the stars look very different today.

Far above the world,
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do.
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can

---
I'm feeling very still,
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
